# Welcome to my first full stack project!

This project involves both the frontend and backend of an example website, with an attempt to get as close to the real application as possible. The frontend uses a combination of Next.js and React and is currently online using Vercel. The backend is handled using an open-source content management system called Strapi, which runs in Docker Container on the DigitalOcean server.
